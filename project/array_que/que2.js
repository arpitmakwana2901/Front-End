// Find the Highest Temperature:
// A weather app shows the temperatures recorded in a city over 7 days as [32, 35, 30, 31, 33, 36, 34]. Write a function to find the highest temperature in the array.
// Hint: Use a loop or the Math.max function.

let temp = [32, 35, 30, 31, 33, 36, 34];

function main(){
    console.log(Math.max(...temp));
