## 1. Create a Library Object:
   A library needs to store books with their titles and authors. Create an object with a method that accepts an array of book titles and their authors, and adds them to the library's collection.
   ```javascript
   const library = {
       books: [],
       addBooks: function(booksArray) {
           // Logic to add books to the object
       }
   };
   ```

## 2. Find the Most Frequent Color in a List:
   Create an object that has a method to find the most frequent color from an array of colors like `["red", "blue", "red", "green", "blue", "blue"]`.

   ```
   

## 3. Student Gradebook:
   Create an object `gradebook` that stores students' names and their grades. It should have a method that accepts an array of students' names and grades, and returns an object where the studentâ€™s name is the key, and their grade is the value.
   ```javascript
   const gradebook = {
       addGrades: function(gradeArray) {
           // Logic to store grades for each student
       }
   };
   ```

## 4. Find Unique Products in Cart:
   Create an object `shoppingCart` that accepts an array of product names and returns an object showing how many times each product appears in the cart.
   ```javascript
   const shoppingCart = {
       getProductFrequency: function(productArray) {
           // Logic to count product occurrences
       }
   };
   ```

## 5. Frequency of Letters in a String:
   Write an object `letterCounter` that accepts a string and returns an object showing the frequency of each letter in the string.
   ```javascript
   const letterCounter = {
       countLetters: function(inputString) {
           // Logic to count occurrences of each letter
       }
   };
   ```


## 6. find out frequency of number in array [ 1,3,4,6,3,4,5,3,4,]

## 7. find the sum of elements whose occurrence is 2 or more than 2.
